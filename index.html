                <p>It’s been another demanding year for organisations in an environment beset by the pandemic, economic
                    uncertainty and, more latterly, intensifying supply chain issues and disruption. If anything, 2021
                    has been just as tough as 2020 was!</p>

                        <p>A personal mission statement can help you identify your values and goals, defining what matters most to you professionally. It makes decision-making easier as well, as it clarifies whether the decisions you're making are in alignment with what you want for your life.</p>

                        <h1>Vission</h1>
                        <p>A life vision is a big picture and has many components that make up what you want your daily life to look like. These “departments” might include: spiritual connection; family and friends; health and wellness; mental, emotional and personal growth; love and relationships; and career, finance and business.</p>

                        <p>A key reason that they feel this way is that they haven't spent enough time thinking about what they want from life, and haven't set themselves formal goals. After all, would you set out on a major journey with no real idea of your destination? Probably not!

                            In the recent past, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government has reiterated its commitment to eradicating terror from our soil, making good on her promises of a more secure nation.
                            Now, ICT Affairs Adviser Sajeeb Wazed Joy is furthering that promise with the inauguration of the national emergency helpline 999.</p>
